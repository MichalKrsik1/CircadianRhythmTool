      <h2>Understanding Light Exposure &amp; Sleep relationship</h2>
      <p>The circadian rhythm, our body's internal clock, influences our sleep patterns, energy levels, and overall health. Light exposure, both natural and artificial, plays a crucial role in regulating this rhythm. This guide is based on the research of neuroscientist Dr. Andrew Huberman and chronobiologist Dr. Samer Hattar.</p>

      <h5><span class="bg-red">Wake up later</span></h5>
      <p>Exposure to light during the "red zone" hours can delay your circadian rhythm, causing you to wake up later.</p>

      <h5><span class="bg-yellow">Wake up sooner</span></h5>
      <p>Light exposure during the "yellow zone" hours can advance your circadian rhythm, leading you to wake up earlier.</p>

      <h5><span class="bg-green">Maintain schedule</span></h5>
      <p>Consistent light exposure during the "green zone" hours will help stabilize your circadian rhythm and maintain your sleep schedule.</p>

      <h5><span class="bg-grey">Dead zone</span></h5>
      <p>During the "grey zone" hours, your body is less responsive to light exposure.</p>

      <h2>Strategies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Engage with light during the hours you desire to be awake.</li>
        <li>Limit light exposure during the hours you want to rest or prepare for sleep.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Helpful Hints</h2>
      <h4>How much light is needed?</h4>
      <p>100k Lux, equivalent to about 5-15 minutes of sunlight exposure (depending on weather and location), is recommended. Artificial light is also effective but generally emits less lux.</p>

      <h4>How to manage light exposure?</h4>
      <p>It's not necessary to completely avoid light. During evenings, aim to reduce light to a level where you can just about manage to see. Your eyes can adjust to much lower light levels than you might expect.</p>

      <h4>Food and exercise during sleep hours</h4>
      <p>Hard exercise and heavy meals can have a similar effect to light on your circadian rhythm. Same rules apply for when to seek / avoid them as with light. </p>
